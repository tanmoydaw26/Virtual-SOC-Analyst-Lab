# Virtual-SOC-Analyst-Lab
Virtual SOC Analyst Lab
A comprehensive virtual environment for training Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring techniques.

Overview
The Virtual SOC Analyst Lab provides a realistic, hands-on environment where cybersecurity professionals and students can practice essential SOC skills without the risks associated with production systems. This lab simulates real-world network traffic, security events, and attack scenarios to develop practical expertise.
